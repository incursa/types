## Layout

- `docs/70-work/items`: active work items named `<ID>-<slug>.md`.
- `docs/70-work/done`: closed items for reference and audit history.
- `docs/70-work/templates`: templates used to create new work items.

## Workflow

1. Start from a template in `docs/70-work/templates/`.
2. Create a new file in `docs/70-work/items/` with a clear ID and slug.
3. Move the item to `docs/70-work/done/` when it is closed or superseded.

## Index
