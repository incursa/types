# Incursa.Types

Incursa.Types is a .NET library of reusable value objects and strongly typed primitives for domain-driven systems.

It helps teams replace loosely typed strings and primitives with explicit domain types that provide predictable parsing, formatting, validation, and serialization behavior.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Incursa.Types
```

## Highlights

- Time-sortable identifiers (`FastId`)
- Money and percentage value objects
- Duration, period, and recurring period primitives
- Path, URL, IP, and CIDR types
- Locale, country, currency, and timezone wrappers
- JSON-friendly types designed for reliable API and persistence boundaries

## Target Framework

- `net8.0`
